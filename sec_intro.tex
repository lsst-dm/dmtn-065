\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

There are several requirements on the Rubin Data Management System (DMS) 
related to Special Programs, summarized in Section~\ref{sec:req}.
This document recommends implementation aspects for Rubin Data Management (RDM)
with respect to these requirements in order to 
enable science from Special Programs (Section~\ref{sec:sci}).

The three main messages of this document are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item All visits associated with a Special Program should have a region and a program label 
which is propagated to all processed images, catalog data, and alerts (Section~\ref{ssec:sci_labels}).
\item All visits that can be processed by the Prompt pipelines and generate 
alerts should be, in support of time domain and Solar System science goals (Section~\ref{ssec:proc_wfd}).
\item ``Unique and separate" data products should be generated by RDM whenever possible 
(e.g., coadded images and {\tt Object} catalogs that overlap, but are deeper or shallower than, the WFD; Section~\ref{ssec:proc_rdm}) 
\end{enumerate}

The following sections provide greater detail and examples in support of these main messages.


\subsection{Terms and Definitions}\label{ssec:intro_terms}

\textbf{Special Programs -- } 
A Rubin Data Management (RDM) term used to refer to survey 
components with specific sky regions within or beyond the 
Wide-Fast-Deep (WFD) main survey, and/or distinct cadences or 
strategies from the WFD main survey.

Special Programs are driven by specific science goals that build on or 
add to the core science pillars of the LSST.
About 10--15\% of the total 10-year LSST time-span will be spent obtaining 
observations associated with Special Programs (and 85--90\% for WFD).

Special Programs includes non-WFD LSST components such as the Deep Drilling 
Fields (DDFs) and the mini-, micro-, and nano-surveys, some of which 
might use non-standard visits with different exposure times.

\textbf{Wide-Fast-Deep (WFD) Main Survey -- }
The core science program of the LSST, designed to achieve the science 
goals defined by the Science Requirements Document (SRD; \citeds{LPM-17}).
It is a contiguous area that covers at least $\sim$18000 deg$^2$ with 
$\gtrsim$800 visits per field, expected to be accomplished with 85--90\% 
of the observing time.

As of the Phase 2 SCOC recommendations in \citeds{PSTN-055}, the WFD area 
is considered to include the low dust extinction extragalactic regions; 
the higher extinction, high stellar density Galactic Plane (GP) and Bulge; the 
Virgo Cluster; the South Celestial Pole (SCP); and the North Ecliptic Spur 
(NES). 

In the past the Galactic, SCP, and NES regions have been referred to as 
``mini-surveys" (see below) but this does not make them ``Special Programs". 
From a survey-scheduling perspective, they are now considered part of the 
WFD survey (whether or not the scheduler software treats them as such).

From a science and data-processing perspective, these components of the 
WFD do not require special processing or separate data products 
(i.e., do not need to be treated by RDM as ``Special Programs").
This is because they will use standard (or alternative) visits and can
be incorporated into WFD Prompt processing (Section~\ref{ssec:proc_wfd}), 
and because their distinct areas do not overlap with the other WFD components 
and so do not require, e.g., separate deep coadds. 


\textbf{Deep Drilling Field (DDF) -- }
A single pointing for which many (e.g., a hundred) visits are obtained 
(usually sequentially) during a single night, and repeated every few 
nights.

As of the Phase 2 SCOC recommendations in \citeds{PSTN-055}, the five 
confirmed DDFs were:

\begin{itemize}
\item Elias S1 (00:37:48, -44:00:00)
\item XMM-LSS (02:22:50, -04:45:00)
\item Extended Chandra Deep Field-South (03:32:30, -28:06:00)
\item COSMOS (10:00:24, +02:10:55)
\item Euclid Deep Field South  (04:04:58, -48:25:23)\footnote{\url{https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/euclid/euclid-survey}}
\end{itemize}

From a science and data-processing perspective, the DDFs do require 
special processing and separate data products (Section~\ref{ssec:proc_rdm}).


\textbf{Mini-, Micro- and Nano-Surveys -- }
Specific sky areas covered by a few hundred, a hundred, or tens of visits 
(respectively; as in Phase 2 SCOC recommendations, \citeds{PSTN-055}).
For a list of the current mini-surveys under consideration, see 
\citeds{PSTN-055}.
This document refers to them all together as mini-surveys.

These sky areas are all (so far) either within or adjacent to the WFD area.
In some cases these visits are non-standard (e.g., short exposures).

From a data-processing and science perspective, most mini-surveys are 
likely to require special processing or separate data products, and should 
be considered on a case-by-base basis.


\textbf{Visit Types -- }
A visit is an observation of a single pointing at a given time, of which 
there are three types:

\begin{itemize}
\item Standard Visit -- Composed of $2\times15$ second exposures (commonly referred to as ``snaps").
\item Alternative Standard Visit -- Composed of a single $30$ second exposure.
\item Non-Standard Visit -- Any other exposure time(s) or number of snaps.
\end{itemize}

The Phase 2 SCOC recommendations for the WFD (\citeds{PSTN-055}) are to 
use alternative standard visits in the $u$-band and standard visits in all 
other bands; variable exposure times were not recommended for the WFD. 
Non-standard visits with shorter or longer exposure times are being 
considered for some mini-surveys.
